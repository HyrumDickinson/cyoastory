    "story": "The farmer says \"It turns out that Vizzinni road was built directly on top of a fault line\nand there was a 9.7 magnitude earthquake! Millions are dead, and hundreds of towns are\nburied under ash and lava. Like Pompey, except worse. Vizzinni, which is near\nMt Vizzinni, which erupted, is buried under miles of lava. Even Chittyville\nitself suffered some damage. Several buildings collapsed including the 8 star hotel\nDelux Chat Qoue.\" You look outside and realize to your horror that you've\ncalmly slept through a massive earthquake.\n\nBut that earthquake pales in comparison to the earthquake in your heart.\nYou fall in love with the farmer and marry them and live happily ever after. THE END.",
